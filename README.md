# Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on various NLP techniques and machine learning models.

# Project Overview
The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for performing sentiment analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization. The Jupyter Notebook showcases various steps required to build a robust sentiment analysis model using Python.
