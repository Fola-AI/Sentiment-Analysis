# Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on various NLP techniques and machine learning models.

# Project Overview
The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for performing sentiment analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization. The Jupyter Notebook showcases various steps required to build a robust sentiment analysis model using Python.

# Repository Contents
Sentiment Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook that includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques for handling text data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
Text vectorization methods such as TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
Implementation of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more.
Model evaluation metrics and visualization.
Dataset: The dataset used in the notebook for sentiment analysis. (Ensure to provide the link to the dataset or include it in the repository if permissible.)
